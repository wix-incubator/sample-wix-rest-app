# Tutorial: Create your first Wix application on your machine
In this tutorial, we go over how to create a Wix application that interacts with the Wix platform so you will be able to submit it to the Wix App Market, where Wix site owners can deploy it on their sites.
## 1. Set up your app in a Wix Developers account 
A. Log in (or sign up) to [Wix Developers](https://dev.wix.com/).

B. Click 

![Create New App](images/create-app.png)

You should get this screen:

![New App](images/New-App.png)

C. Go to Workspace > OAuth and copy your `App ID` and `App Secret Key`. You will need them later.

## 2. Set up the application to receive inbound HTTPS connections
Since most developers machine are not open for inbound connection and don't have HTTPS certificates, we will describe the process using **ngrok**.
(If you are hosting your application on a server without these restrictions, you can skip this step.)

Install and run [ngrok](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started)

**Note:** Start an HTTP tunnel on the port your app is listening on  (default is 3000)
You should get something like this:

![ngrok screen](images/ngrok.png)

**Don't close the ngrok process** - You will need it running for the entire process.

## 3. Set up your application URLs
A. Go to Workspace > OAuth
B. In **`Redirect URL`** enter: `https://<12345678>.ngrok.io/login`
C. In **`App URL`** enter: `https://<12345678>.ngrok.io/signup`  
**Remember to replace '12345678' with ** your ngrok string you got above.**
for example:

![Listening](images/httpsurl.png)


![update application urls](images/urls.png)

D. Click Save.

![save](images/save.png)

## 4. Register your application to receive your first webhook
A. Go to Workspace > Webhooks and add a new webhook.

C. In the **config.js file (in the `src` folder)**: 
 - find and replace the APP_ID with the value you copied from Wix Developers:
![Change app id](images/change-config.png)   
 -  find and replace the PUBLIC_KEY with the value you copied from Wix Developers:
![Change public key](images/change-public-key.png)  

D. In the **credentials.js file (in the `src` folder)** find and replace the APP_SECRET  with the value you copied from Wix Developers:
